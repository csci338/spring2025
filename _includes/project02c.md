## Minimum Required Features
All teams must:
- Create at least **two new database models** (e.g., `StudySession`, `Internship`, `StudyGroup`, `Task`, `Calendar`).
- Build FastAPI endpoints for any relevant **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) needed to support the
functionality of your site.
- Develop React UI components/screens to interact with FastAPI endpoints.
- Give the app a **look and feel** (colors, fonts, styling, accessibility, usability, etc.).
- **Enforce security** (users should not see data that doesn’t belong to them).
- Write **tests** for all backend functionality (you don't need to run tessts for React stuff) and ensure
linter/formatter checks pass.
- **Cloud deployment** – Update Dockerfile to integrate dependencies and schemas.
