description: >
   Continuous integration (CI), static analysis, and testing are complementary software development techniques that ensure that teams can deploy software
   continuously with a high degree of confidence in the quality of their code.
   In this unit, we will learn about ways you and your team can automate code testing and validation procedures before merging code updates into the main branch. By setting up a few tools up front, you will save time and energy and increase the reliability of your code base.
