"Culture" is a  big topic in tech, and can encompass many different ideas, including:
* **Interpersonal stuff** -- e.g., how teams build software, make decisions, resolve conflicts, absorb shocks, etc. And also how cultural practices around race, class, gender, ethnicity, disability, etc. can affect how people are treated and the opportunities they can access.
* **Organizational stuff** -- how companies are organized, how management makes decisions, etc.
* **Societal stuff** -- how assumptions and beliefs that start in tech shops reverberate into society...and conversely how society shapes the kinds of technologies we build.
