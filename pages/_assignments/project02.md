> ## Learning Objectives
> This project is designed to give you practice working with real-world software engineering tools and practices including:
> 
> 1. **Version Control Workflows & DevOps**
     * Extending and contributing to an existing codebase.
     * Using version control workflows (branches, commits, merges, pull requests).
     * Working within the continous integration pipeline (linting, testing, GitHub Actions).
     * Debugging and troubleshooting deployment issues in a realistic environment.
     * "Everything as code" -- managing your dependencies, containers, continuous integration pipelines, and infrastructure configurations in declarative files (e.g., `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `compose.yml`, GitHub workflow `.yml` files).
     * Deploying a full-stack app to a cloud platform (e.g., Render, Railway, or Fly.io).
> 
> 1. **Project Management & Communication**
    * Creating a shared project plan, assign tasks, and manage progress.
    * Communicating effectively with teammates during development.
    * Identifying meaningful new features that add value to a real-world academic planning tool.
    * Translating ideas into working, testable software components.
> 
> 1. **Programming**
    * Designing and implementing new backend routes using FastAPI.
    * Creating and using new SQLAlchemy models to represent domain concepts.
    * Building corresponding frontend screens with React and TypeScript.
    * Connecting frontend and backend using RESTful API conventions.
    * Writing tests

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to extend a partially completed Academic Planning web application built with **React** (frontend), **FastAPI** (backend), and **PostgreSQL** (database) using **SQLAlchemy** (ORM).

This tool currently supports basic features like viewing available courses and adding them to a schedule. Your job is to enhance it by designing and implementing two new API routes, two new models, and two corresponding screens in the frontend. Your additions should provide real value to users—think creatively about what students, advisors, or faculty might need in a planning tool.

In addition to coding, this project emphasizes collaboration, version control workflow, and deployment. You’ll be expected to use Git to manage your work, open Pull Requests for review, and deploy your final project to a cloud platform.

You’ll work in small teams, planning features together, dividing work, resolving conflicts, and managing deadlines. Use your project management skills to create a plan and iterate toward a polished final product. 

## Roles and Responsibilities
There are many different roles that are necessary to make your project successful. Talk with your team around dividing up these roles. Multiple people can share a role; people can also rotate in and out of roles. You get to decide.

## Project Scope
Your team will extend this code to be more useful. The theme is **"student academic management"**, but you may interpret this broadly. Possible ideas include:

### Course Planner
- Enhancing the schedule UI by displaying a weekly calendar of their courses.
- Allowing students to map out the remaining courses they're thinking of taking.

### Study Group Manager
- Matches students with peers based on shared courses and availability.
- Could include a chat or note-taking feature.
- Each course could have an area for taking notes, uploading screenshots, etc.

### Internship / REU Tracker
- Assists students in tracking job applications and networking contacts.
- Helps plan how to incorporate course assignments/projects into a resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, or portfolio.

### Task / Assignment Tracker
- Users log assignments, deadlines, and progress for each course.
- Could include email/text notifications.

### Work/Life Balance Support
- Helps students consider how coursework supports other life priorities.

### Some other idea of your choice...
- Feel free to propose your own interpretation of this assignment. Creativity is encouraged.

## Minimum Required Features
All teams must:
- Create at least **two new database models** (e.g., `StudySession`, `Internship`, `StudyGroup`, `Task`).
- Build FastAPI endpoints for any relevant **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) needed to support the functionality of your site.
- Develop React UI components/screens to interact with FastAPI endpoints.
- Give the app a **look and feel** (colors, fonts, styling, accessibility, usability, etc.).
- **Enforce security** (users should not see data that doesn’t belong to them).
- Write **tests** for all backend functionality (you don't need to run tessts for React stuff) and ensure linter/formatter checks pass.
- **Cloud deployment** – Update Dockerfile to integrate dependencies and schemas.
