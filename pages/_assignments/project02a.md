Before beginning implementation, your team must submit a brief proposal outlining your planned features for approval, following the guidelines outlined below. To submit this assignment, one person will create a markdown file at the root of your project called `PROPOSAL.md`, with all of the components outlined in the instructions. The author of `PROPOSAL.md` will make a pull request and then have another member of their team review and approve it. Once the PR has been approved, make sure to merge it into `main`.


## 1. Project Description

Write a brief (1–2 paragraph) summary of what your team plans to build. Describe:

- The feature or extension you’re adding to the academic planning tool
- The problem it solves or what it improves
- Who it’s for (target user)
- The two new models, API routes, and UI screens you're planning to add


> **Sample Description:**
> We are building a Course Review feature that allows students to leave feedback on courses. This helps future students make informed choices. Our models will include `Review` and `RatingSummary`. Routes will allow users to create and fetch reviews. New UI screens will include a review form and a ratings dashboard.



## 2. Team Roles & Responsibilities
List your team members and the role(s) and responsibilities they will take on. You are welcome (even encouraged) to share roles and collaborate on features.

| Name         | Role                    | Responsibilities |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| [Name]       | Project Manager / Scrum | - [Responsibility 1] <br> - [Responsibility 2] |
