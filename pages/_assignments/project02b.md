## Your Tasks
This assignment will be elaborated further, but the basic requirements include:
1. Working modifications to backend and frontend
1. Cloud deployment of current app complete. I recommend:
    * Supabase for the database
    * Render for the webserver (I've already verified that the Dockerfile works well with Render)
    * I can make a walkthrough video of how to do a cloud deployment and integrate it with GitHub actions in the next week or so.
1. Some sort of reflection from your team re: how things are going and what's still left to do.
