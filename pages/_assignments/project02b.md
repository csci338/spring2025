## What to Submit
For the mid-point deliverable, one member of your team should submit the following:

1. A link to your team's repo. The `main` branch of your repo should include the following:
    * Some substantiv changes to both backend and frontend functionality (but can still all be work in progress).
    * A document called `MIDPOINT.md` that summarizes:
        1. What you've done
        1. Who did what
        1. What you plan to complete by next Tuesday (5/6)

    In addition, all formatting/linting tasks and automated tests should pass

1. A link to your working cloud deployment. If you need some guidance on this, please see videos #8, #9, and #10 above.
